        <br>
        <text style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">The Robotics & Coding Club serves as the perfect space for students who are interested in the design and development of robotics and software.  Its members, ranging from aspiring developers to complete novices, spend the year learning about concepts, working on projects and/or participating in team-based competitions such as hackathons and/or the VEX Robotics Competition (VRC).   Advisor:  Mr. Hanas  (Status:  Active)</text>
        <br><br>
        <text style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">ROCO is currently divided into three sections: Python, JavaScript, and the hack room. The Python class is meant for beginners who are new to coding. They will learn Python fundamentals and intermediate programming concepts. The javascript class is for advanced students who want to learn about JavaScript fundamentals, web development, and ReactJS. The hack room is for general coding events and competitions. It encourages team-based work and learning.</text>
